                                            <div class="event-detail-des-content"><p>Britain has welcomed more than 1.8 million full-time undergraduate students in higher education, including 104,000 international students. UK is one of the most diverse economics which helps students to get valuable expertise to battle the world. The students find close association with the education system in UK with attractive career perspective, hence most preferred destination. UK offers variety courses from graduates and undergraduate programs in various reputed universities.</p>

                                                <p><h2>Why UK?</h2></p>

                                                <p>Degrees and qualifications from UK higher education institutions are known around the world as high quality and world class. This standard of excellence is set by some of the older universities with recognizable names, such as Oxford and Cambridge, but the tradition carries through to many of the universities and colleges throughout the UK.</p>

                                                <p>The cost of education for an international student in the UK can beis generally lower compared to the USA and other countries. Programs in the USA can be $25,000 or more a year in tuition alone. Tuition for the majority of UK higher education institutions generally £6,000 to £7,000 a year – considerably less!</p>

                                                <p>An international student in the UK is typically allowed to work up to 20 hours a week during school term, and up to full-time when school is out of term. Of course, you should always check with your international advisor at your school before starting any work – you do not want to be in violation of your visa, and rules change frequently. Also, it is not always easy to find a job, so relying on work income to fund your education is not a good idea. Unless you have employment set up through your school before you arrive, you should plan to fund the entire first year of your studies without any employment income. </p>
