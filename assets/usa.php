                                            <div class="event-detail-des-content"><p>With one of the most diverse education system in the world embedding the world’s top 10  academic institutions, US provides not only intellectual and job-ready professional skills but also  a tradition and culture of personal and professional development  for their entire lifetime.

                                                <p><h2>Why USA?</h2></p>

                                                <p>More international students study in the USA than any other country, and for good reason. While many of the world’s top institutions reside in the US, there are also more than 4,000 other world-class universities offering a top-notch education that can lead to career success. The US remains the source of most of the world’s ground-breaking developments in technology, business, arts, and beyond.</p>

                                                <p>US education is recognized all over the world. 30 of the top 100 best world universities are located in the US, as ranked by Quacquarelli Symonds World University Rankings for 2015/2016. One of the reasons students at US universities are so successful upon graduation is because they were educated in the “liberal arts”. This means a focus, not just on a specific major, but on other subjects such as various maths and sciences, philosophy, history, and literature.</p>

                                                <p>US universities place great significance on diversity, meaning classes will consist of students of all ages, religions, and countries of origin. This provides a stimulating and rich learning environment which encourages cross-cultural understanding and networking. Most classes will contain no more than 20 students and the professors will take the time to get to know students and support their learning even outside the classroom. </p>

                                                <p>International students in the US can work in a job on campus up to 20 hours a week. Most find that their time is better spent taking internships, or Curricular Practical Training, which allows students to work for university credit in a job in a related field. Nearly every university, even those not located in big cities, has employees dedicated to helping students secure internships.</p>
