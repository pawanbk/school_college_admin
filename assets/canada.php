                                            <div class="event-detail-des-content"><p>Canada is the second largest country in the world with some of the largest cities like Toronto, Vancouver, Ottawa, Montreal, etc.  Canada has 93 universities and around 900 full time colleges. It is the safest and best place in the world to live according to UN. Two official languages: English and French are widely spoken and it provides internationally recognized degrees, affordable education, and excellent health care. Canada spends more per capital on education than any other country.</p>

                                                <p><h2>Why Canada?</h2></p>

                                                <p>In the past three years, Canadian inflation rate compared to industrial countries is one of the lowest. Canadian Institutes, charge lower tuition fees for international students than their counterparts in competing countries and at the same time, maintain excellent educational quality. However as the fees are more affordable, admissions are more competitive.</p>

                                                <p>International students can apply for their Permanent Residency which takes up to 15 to 18 months from within Canada. However they need to meet the minimum eligibility criteria of 67 Points.</p>

                                                <p>Students in Canada are allowed to work part time on campus during the first 6 months of their program and off campus part time thereafter. The duration permitted is up to 20 hours per week. Several programs may even have a paid co-op term where one gets hands on experience on working in the industry. Further students on the completion of their program of 1 year can work up to 1 year and students applying for 2 years program can work for 2-3 years.</p>
